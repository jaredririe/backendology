# iOS Markdown App Comparison: 1Writer vs. iA Writer

In writing posts for my new blog, I have settled on markdown. It's a natural fit for software engineers as we are used to working with plain text in minimalist editors rather than heavy-handed word processors like Microsoft Word. On my laptop where I will write most of my posts, I customized Sublime Text 3 for markdown using the [MarkdownEditing plugin](). I am already a Sublime Text power user, so it was a natural fit. 

The best markdown app for iOS was a less clear-cut decision, so I thought I would share some of the top contenders and my overall choice.

## The Contenders

* 1Writer
* iA Writer
* Byword

### 1Writer

#### Pros

- Customizable: several font choices, font sizes, keyboard top row, etc. 
- Six themes, including two dark options (black and gray)
- In-app browser for research without leaving the app. Ability to translate text on a webpage into markdown. 

#### Cons

- Black theme has only red accents
- User interface feels clunky and unintuitive at times 
	- Two swipes left and a tap gets you to settings 
	- Swipe on the right edge of the screen takes you to the in-app browser—this gesture seems wasted as it could have been used for initiating markdown preview instead

### iA Writer

#### Pros

- Big, easy-to-find blue cursor
- Focus mode which highlights only the selected sentence
- First-class support for syncing through Dropbox was removed
    + You can still find files in Dropbox, but it's not as seamless as working with files stored under "iAWriter" in iCloud

#### Cons

- Opinionated: sometimes these opinions match up with my opinion and sometimes they don’t (your mileage may vary)
- Little font customization: one font and three sizes in editor mode
