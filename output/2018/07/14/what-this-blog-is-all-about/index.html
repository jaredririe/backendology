<h2 id="backended">&ldquo;Backended&rdquo;?</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things (Phil Karlton).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or, my favorite variant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off by one errors (Unknown)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naming is hard. Backended isn&rsquo;t a real word. &ldquo;Back ended&rdquo; and its hyphened form &ldquo;back-ended&rdquo; do appear to be real words, though rarely used and completely unrelated to the purpose of this blog. Like the programmer who decides to write a lengthy comment rather than coming up with a better name, I&rsquo;ll try to explain what I intended when I named this blog Backended.</p>

<p>Backended draws obvious reference to the term &ldquo;backend” as in backend or server-side web development. If it was a real word, I might say, &ldquo;Because of my backended nature, writing frontend code is inherently painful.&rdquo; I find the problems that get solved on the backend to be incredibly interesting and therefore chose it as the underlying theme of my blog.</p>

<h2 id="topics-i-plan-to-cover">Topics I plan to cover</h2>

<p>While this list does not aim to be exhaustive, it should give a good sense for topics I will cover in this blog. I’ll also briefly elaborate on why each topic deserves attention.</p>

<h3 id="distributed-systems">Distributed systems</h3>

<p>Many backend systems are an entanglement of services which together can be considered a distributed system. Rather than being monolithic in nature, these systems benefit from things like <strong>independent deployability</strong>, <strong>focused development</strong>, and <strong>loose coupling</strong> yet suffer from the complexities of <strong>partial failure</strong>, <strong>lack of concurrency guarantees</strong>, and <strong>network boundaries</strong>.</p>

<p>This list of tradeoffs is clearly incomplete. Each complexity deserves its own blog post! Once network boundaries exist between components of a system, for example, problems such as discoverability must be dealt with. No longer can I make an easy function call; rather, I must build in some way for one service to find another service and then make a network call. This call could fail (should I retry?) or time out (how long should I wait?). Once I&rsquo;ve figured out how to handle these failure scenarios, does <em>every</em> service I write need to duplicate this logic or can I abstract it away through a form of middleware?</p>

<p>Fascinating!</p>

<p>Topics like caching, consistency, reverse proxying, API gateways, and service meshes are fair game.</p>

<h3 id="go">Go</h3>

<p>Go is a phenomenal language for backend development. I started writing Go in October 2015 and haven&rsquo;t looked back. I&rsquo;ll be writing several blog posts where I solve problems using Go or otherwise talk about it.</p>

<p>Go is easy to learn, proven in production, and designed for the cloud. It&rsquo;s deployed in production by high-traffic companies like Google, Dropbox, Uber, and Facebook in cases where stability and high performance are critical. Many open-source cloud computing tools are written in Go like Docker and Consul.</p>

<p>I enjoy its strong focus on simplicity which translates to less ramp-up time for new developers. Another benefit is in maintainability of Go codebases, as it’s very readable and easy to understand existing code.</p>

<h3 id="nosql-and-general-database-concepts">NoSQL and general database concepts</h3>

<p>NoSQL is a movement that started in response to a need for increased scalability in large cloud companies like Google and Amazon. In my mind, NoSQL is less of a rebuttal of relational databases (i.e. <em>No, SQL!</em>) and more of an alternative to SQL when it makes sense for the problem being solved (i.e. <em>Not Only SQL</em>).</p>

<p>I have worked with a large variety of NoSQL databases in my time at Qualtrics. Some have turned out extraordinarily well while others turned out quite the opposite! These experiences left me with this conclusion: <strong>database choice is often more important than programming language choice</strong>. In order to make an informed decision, you need to be well-educated in general database concepts such as consistency and data modeling.</p>

<h3 id="software-and-non-software-books">Software and non-software books</h3>

<p>I have become an avid reader of technical books, as well as popular non-fiction books like &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1501111108/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1501111108&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jaredririeblo-20&amp;linkId=c173ddc20b9a9fcd700e582440ca8479">Grit</a>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345472322/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0345472322&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jaredririeblo-20&amp;linkId=28b35ebce32bc00c963a529c58070d49">Mindset</a>,” and “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455554790/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1455554790&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jaredririeblo-20&amp;linkId=fff6e98d9dd5016e1aa4be73e0368874">Work Rules!</a>” ever since I graduated from college. I read five books each quarter, so 20 books/year. And by read, I really read <em>or</em> listen; I&rsquo;m an advocate of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NB86OYE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00NB86OYE&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jaredririeblo-20&amp;linkId=627d0e41b121bbc9b5a33b365e23a2d7">Audible</a> and think it&rsquo;s a solid investment.</p>

<p>I’m planning on writing a post for each book I read with a summary of the content, further learning it inspired, and my overall recommendation. Here are some books on my reading list:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GSTOAM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B001GSTOAM&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=jaredririeblo-20&amp;linkId=2596e9caf8f63700450812054449c5d0">Clean Code</a></li>

<h3 id="research-papers">Research papers</h3>

<p>I was one week away from attending graduate school. I had accepted an offer and scholarship from the University of Wisconsin: Madison, enrolled in classes, and found an apartment. Then, in a last-minute decision, I walked away from it all a week before classes started. I&rsquo;ll share the full story in a later blog.</p>

<p>While I still believe this was the correct choice given my circumstances, I regret not being able to delve into Computer Science research. Reading research papers has been more of a hit and miss for me than reading books. I hope this blog can serve as the necessary motivation to read more research papers and review them as blog entries. The research papers I have read, such as <a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">Amazon’s well-known Dynamo paper</a> have been influential in improving my design skills and identifying weak areas in my understanding.</p>

<h3 id="up-and-coming-backend-technology">Up-and-coming backend technology</h3>

<p>The backend is notably more stable than the frontend. The database terminology or <a href="http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/">distributed consensus algorithm</a> you learned a few years ago will still be relevant for a long time. Meanwhile, if you picked up AngularJS around the same time, you know it was soon eclipsed by Angular and then React and now maybe Vue.js.</p>

<p><img src="/public/images/service-mesh-istio-google-trends.png" alt="Google Trends for Service Mesh and Istio" /></p>

<p>That said, the backend is still encapsulated in the ever-changing thing which is technology. “Service mesh” is one example of a backend idea that has only recently entered my vocabulary. It is a solution to dealing with the varied interactions between services in a network of microservices. <a href="https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/overview/">Istio</a> is an example project I’ll cover in a later blog. I plan to regularly write about new technologies of this nature.</p>

<h3 id="architecture-and-system-design">Architecture and system design</h3>

<p>One of the benefits of working at a smaller company is the opportunity to be involved in key architectural discussions even early in your career. Such has been the case for me at Qualtrics where I have been able to influence large chunks of the backend. I know, however, that I&rsquo;m still in my infancy in terms of my ability to design elegant solutions to cross-cutting problems in a system. I am confident that as I improve my system design skills, I will be able to make a bigger impact on the technical direction of my software team.</p>
